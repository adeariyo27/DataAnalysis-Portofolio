# DataAnalyst-Portofolio
Hi Everyone! My name is Ade Ariyo Yudanto, a system and network engineer at Palu Administrative Court (part of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia) who is preparing to switch careers as a data analyst or data scientist. This is a repository of Projects and Mini-Projects I've worked on. Several Projects and Mini-Projects are the result of assignments and training at DQLab (an online learning platform that focuses on introducing Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) and Myskill (a career preparation and skills improvement platform).
